# 15 Exercises to Know a Programming Language

This repo holds my implementations of Larry O'Brien's recommended exercises to learn and
cement your knowledge of a programming language.

Divided into 3 parts with increasing difficulty; calculations, data structures and libraries.

I've chosen to implement these exercises following the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD).
This helps to further test the respective language by exploring its unit testing capabilities.
